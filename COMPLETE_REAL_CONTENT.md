### **About Section (Complete):**

```
Entrepreneurial operator and digital strategy leader with 10+ years of experience scaling SaaS, IT, and web platform companies. Co-founded Arc4 in 2023 after nearly a decade at Yext, growing it into a multimillion-dollar consultancy serving Fortune 500 clients with a 96% retention rate.

At Arc4, I oversee end-to-end client success across industries including multi-location retail, franchises, healthcare, and financial services. I partner closely with organizations to modernize their digital presence, improve operational efficiency, and create content ecosystems that perform in both traditional search and emerging AI-driven discovery. Whether coordinating distributed teams, auditing technology stacks, or guiding long-term transformation roadmaps, I bring a practical, systems-first approach rooted in measurable outcomes.

Before Arc4, I spent 8 years at Yext across Implementation, Solutions Engineering, and Solutions Architecture—learning the platform inside and out and developing deep expertise in website architecture, SEO/GEO, IT systems, and integrations. This technical foundation, combined with experience in both pre-sales and post-sales, gives me a complete view of the sales-to-implementation process.

I'm passionate about building durable companies and healthy teams—the kind that ship great work consistently and enjoy the process along the way. The lessons I've learned from training for Ironman competitions, summiting mountains, and backcountry skiing have shaped how I approach business: discipline over intensity, systems over heroics, and sustained effort over unsustainable sprints.

Outside of Arc4, you'll find me chasing endurance goals, exploring new places, and reading anything that mixes adventure with a little existential reflection. Whether it's 140.6 miles of an Ironman or building a consultancy from zero to 27 people, I believe the same principles apply: clarity of purpose, relentless execution, and the humility to learn along the way.
